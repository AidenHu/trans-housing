trans-housing
=============

Main repo for CPSC 439b group project

> Just a check that we can push from CL to git.yale.edu
> Seems to be working!

+ Able to access from VM
+ Need to import Google Doc assignments

Usage: `git clone https://git.yale.edu/TransHousing/trans-housing`

Had problem with git fetch and merge, here's for experiment.
So the contents in Sublime Text changes whenever git checkout into a different branch, cool!
